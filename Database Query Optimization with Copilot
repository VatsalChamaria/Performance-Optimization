(Apply Optimization Suggestions)
Indexing Strategies

CREATE INDEX idx_product_id_orders ON Orders(ProductID);
CREATE INDEX idx_product_id_products ON Products(ProductID);
CREATE INDEX idx_category_products ON Products(Category);


(Query Restructuring Techniques)
Optimized query:

SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(o.Quantity) AS TotalSold
FROM Orders o
JOIN Products p ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE p.Category = 'Electronics'
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC;


(Compare Execution Plans
Before Optimization:

Use EXPLAIN to analyze the execution plan of the original query.)
(Before Optimization)

EXPLAIN SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(o.Quantity) AS TotalSold
FROM Orders o
JOIN Products p ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE p.Category = 'Electronics'
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC;

(After Optimization:)

EXPLAIN SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(o.Quantity) AS TotalSold
FROM Orders o
JOIN Products p ON o.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE p.Category = 'Electronics'
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC;
